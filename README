README (Short summary of this repository):

This repository was made by Kouda_Ha of Moop (Open-source Games) for a charity event called Sparkle Sanctuary by 
(Sparkle: The National Trans Charity).

The event is a safe space held in person in Manchester, UK. The April event includes a workshop for "Text Adventure 101" where 
we will be teaching people how to use Twine (https://twinery.org/), the open source tool / Games Engine for making interactive 
stories.

It is a very basic and made with the assumption that there will be people who have never touched games design, development, or 
computer programming at any level.

This repo includes:
- Games Design Document
- Twine Tutorial Document
- Twine Story Ideas Document
- One HTML Games file to import into Twine for a simple text adventure
- One HTML Games file to import into Twine for a simple "escape room" style game 
(3 collectables (currently called 'keys') and a timer (currently 300 seconds) that can both be changed at will)

We have tried our best to make both templates easy to understand and edit, and Kouda_Ha from Moop will be at the event for the 
entire event to help people with downloading and setting up Twine, using Twine, thinking of gaming ideas, any bugs / issues or confusion, 
and anything else that may be needed for the "Text Adventure 101" workshop.
